# PokemonApp

This project is a Pokémon information platform built with Angular 17. It allows users to browse a list of Pokémon and view detailed information about each one, including their evolution chain.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.2.2.

## Features

- Browse Pokémon in a grid layout.
- View detailed information about each Pokémon, including height, weight, and evolution chain.
- Responsive design for viewing on various devices and screen sizes.

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pradeep-kr27/pokemon-app.git
cd your-angular-pokemon-project

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
